<h3>
Synchronization<br>
</h3>
<p>You can synchronize playback
between Softsqueeze with Squeezebox2, Squeezebox and slimp3 hardware
players, allowing you to create a 'whole house' audio system. To enable
synchronization use either the <span style="font-family: monospace;">Settings
&gt;
Synchronize</span> menu in the
players, or the<span style="font-family: monospace;"> Player Settings</span>
web pages in the Slimserver.</p>
<h3>How does synchronization work?</h3>
<p>The Slimserver controls the
audio buffer and playback on all the players that are synchronized
together. When a track starts all the players are paused, and the audio
buffers are filled ready for playback. The Slimserver monitors how full
the audio buffers are, and when the buffers in all players have reached
70% or greater then a play command is sent to all the players. This
process is repeated at the start of each track to ensure that music
stays synchronized.</p>
<p>When synchronization is
working, it works well. If you can hear any delay then you need to
trouble shoot your system.</p>
<h3>Trouble shooting</h3>
Getting synchronization to work can sometimes by tricky. The common
problems are described here.<br>
<h4>I can hear a delay between the
players<br>
</h4>
<p>The most common problem is when
you can hear a delay between the players. This is usually caused by
audio latency in Softsqueeze, and in most cases this is fixable.<br>
</p>
<p> On <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows</span>
to get synchronization working you must use <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/downloads/ea/index.html">Java
5.0</a> (also
know as Java 1.5). Early versions of Java
have up to half a second latency in the audio playback. You can
check what version of Java you are using by looking in the Softsqueeze
preferences.</p>
<p>On <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows</span>
you must select the Primary Sound Driver.&nbsp; Once Softsqueeze is
running using Java 5.0 check to make sure that the Audio Mixer is set
to the Primary Sound Driver.</p>
<p>On <span style="font-weight: bold;">OSX</span>
you may get a small delay in playback<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span>
The latest version of Java released by Apple is Java 1.4.2. This
version of Java has a small audio latency. Tiger is meant to include
Java 5.0 for OSX , but I do not yet know if the javasound
implementation had been improved.</p>
<p>On <span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux</span>
you must be using Java 1.4 or later and use an&nbsp; <a
 href="http://www.alsa-project.org/" target="_top">ALSA</a>
0.9.2 or later audio driver. [Could someone who has this working please
send me some instructions. Thanks].<br>
</p>
<h4>It sounds ok to start with,
but loses it in the middle of a track</h4>
<p>Sometimes the audio playback
with Softsqueeze may have small gaps in. This becomes really noticeable
when playing with synchronization. Usually this is because you are
trying to use you PC to do other activities while using Softsqueeze -
the CPU in your PC cannot keep up with all the tasks it needs to do.</p>
<p>On <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows</span>
you can try increasing the priority of Softsqueeze using the Task
Manager. In the <span style="font-family: monospace;">Application</span>
tab right click on the Softsqueeze application and select <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Go To Process</span>.
This highlights the Softsqueeze process in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Process</span>
tab, right click again and change the priority in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Set Priority</span>
menu.</p>
<p>On <span style="font-weight: bold;">OSX</span>
or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux</span>
try increasing the priority of Softsqueeze using the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">top</span>
command.</p>
<p>Recently another cause of the
gaps has been found. The Java 'garbage collector' can sometimes stop
the Softsqueeze process long enough to cause gaps in the playback. I am
looking into how best to fix this, but as a workaround you can start
Softsqueeze from the <a href="download.html#commandline">command line</a>,
using [if you try this then please let me know if it works]:</p>
<pre>java -Xms64m -Xmx128m -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC <br> -XX:SurvivorRatio=2 -XX:NewRatio=8 -jar SoftSqueeze.jar</pre>
<h4>Only the first track is
delayed, synchronization seems fine after that</h4>
In earlier version of Softsqueeze the first track probably will not be
synchronized. This is fixed in Softsqueeze2.<br>
